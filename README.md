## Run Server

- To run local
```bash
make
```
or
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- Stop preview server, but leave constructed files in project for your review.
```bash
make stop
```

- Stop server and "clean" constructed files, best choice when renaming files to eliminate potential duplicates in constructed files.
```bash
make clean
```

- Test notebook conversions, best choice to see if IPYNB conversion is acting up.
```bash
make convert
    ```
