Question 35:

Directions: Select the choice that best fits each statement. The following question(s) refer to the following information
Consider the following binarySearch method. The method correctly performs a binary search.


```java
// Precondition: data is sorted in increasing order

public static int binarySearch(int[] data, int target)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = data.length - 1;
    while (start <= end)
    {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (target < data[mid])
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else if (target > data[mid])
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        else{
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return - 1;
}
```


```java
int[] values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8};
int target = 8;
```

**Purpose** 

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted array or list. We repeatedly divide the search range in half until the target value is found or the range becomes empty. This results in a time complexity of O(log n), making it more efficient than linear search for large datasets.

What is the difference between linear and binary search?

**Speed**

Binary search is typically much faster than linear sort. We can see that the number of iterations needed to find the target using linear search is 11, while the iterations needed to find the target using binary search is 3.

Java code for iterative binary search is generally the same...
Here is an example


```java
public static int binarySearchExample(int[] intArray, int lowPosition, int highPosition, int target){
    int midPosition;

    // Step 1: Initialize a while loop to continue until the lowPosition is greater than the highPosition
    while (lowPosition <= highPosition){
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the middle position of the current range
        midPosition = (highPosition + lowPosition) / 2;

        // Step 3: Check if the target is greater than the element at midPosition
        if (intArray[midPosition] < target) {
            // Step 3a: Adjust the lowPosition to search in the right half of the current range
            lowPosition = midPosition + 1;
        }
        // Step 4: Check if the target is less than the element at midPosition
        else if (intArray[midPosition] > target) {
            // Step 4a: Adjust the highPosition to search in the left half of the current range
            highPosition = midPosition - 1;
        }
        // Step 5: If the target is equal to the element at midPosition, return midPosition
        else {
            return midPosition;
        }
    }

    // Step 6: If the while loop exits without finding the target, return -1
    return -1;
}

```

Now lets return to the question...

| Iteration | Index             | Comparison       | New End |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------ |---------|
| 1         | (0 + 7) / 2 = 3   | data[3] < 8       | 4       |
| 2         | (4 + 7) / 2 = 5   | data[5] = 5       | -       |


Since data[5] is 8, 5 is returned.

When we run the code in a notebook, we get 5.


```java
binarySearch(values, target)
```

**Question 1:**
What is the primary advantage of using iterative binary search over linear search?

A. Iterative binary search is easier to implement.

B. Iterative binary search has a faster average time complexity.

C. Iterative binary search is more suitable for unsorted arrays.

D. Iterative binary search guarantees finding the element in the first iteration.

**Question 2:**
In the iterative binary search algorithm, how is the middle position calculated?

A. midPosition = (highPosition + lowPosition) / 2;

B. midPosition = (highPosition - lowPosition) / 2;

C. midPosition = highPosition * lowPosition / 2;

D. midPosition = (highPosition + lowPosition) * 2;

**Question 3:**

B. To increase the time complexity.

C. To search the entire array in each iteration.

D. To narrow down the search range based on comparisons.

**Question 5:**
If the target element is not present in the array, what value does the iterative binary search function return?

```
public static int binarySearch(int[] data, int target)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = data.length - 1;
    while (start <= end)
    {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (target < data[mid])
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else if (target > data[mid])
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        else{
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return - 1;
}
```

A. -1

B. 0

C. The index of the last element in the array.

D. The target element itself.

**Question 6:**
```
public static int iterativeBinarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int[] sortedArray = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 42};
int target1 = 16;
int result1 = iterativeBinarySearch(sortedArray, target1);

int target2 = 30;
int result2 = iterativeBinarySearch(sortedArray, target2);

B. result1 = 4, result2 = 5

C. result1 = -1, result2 = 5

D. result1 = 5, result2 = -1

**Question 7:**
What line of code is needed to complete this integrative Binary Search algorithm?

    while (lowPosition <= highPosition){
        midPosition = (highPosition + lowPosition) / 2;

        if (intArray[midPosition] < target) {
            <!-- ADD CODE HERE -->
        }
        else if (intArray[midPosition] > target) {

        }
        else {
            return midPosition;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

A. highPosition = midPosition + 1;

B. highPosition = midPosition - 1;
