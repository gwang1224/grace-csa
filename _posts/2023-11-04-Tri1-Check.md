# Grace's Trimester 1 Individual Check

## Collaboration

[Click-Up](https://app.clickup.com/9011012769/v/dc/8chj951-471/8chj951-171)
- Rachit and I discussed frontend and backend visions

## Individual Code: Backend

![Backend Contributions](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170900703162679306/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_5.40.48_PM.png?ex=655ab941&is=65484441&hm=807a77301620d28011102c13c21f44fb595428d5b822e36b31c59a4bc068069a&)


### Problems: broken backend
- a GREAT learning opportunity
- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/TheoH32/stocktifyBackend/commit/71ed893a3e9ad703d4f8d8543405477cf823f5ec)
- What I learned: don't add code onto the backend that doesn't work

### Stock API

#### Iteration 1

- I used OOP in in the backend for our API controller
- class StockDataApiController

![Postman](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170903964334698577/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_5.54.12_PM.png?ex=655abc4b&is=6548474b&hm=6e77ffd8234fa8134b43ad7f46fbe4a4df0cf2b1498c9068ef6e21ff1d4bd5b8&)


#### Iteration 2

- used API from Alpha Vantage
- class contains 3 methods (getStockData, getStocks, getNews)
- Learned about @GetMapping annotation
    - same thing as GET method in Python backend
- Learned about @RequestParam
    - basically gets a request parameter, which allows a user endpoint such as "/stockdata?symbol=XYZ"
- is then connected to the search button on the front end, which allows users to loop up stocks by their stock symbol

![API call Google](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170904355227050014/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_5.55.46_PM.png?ex=655abca8&is=654847a8&hm=1811d46c99f28b94482851b0b92fae08b5d3262d5c55e99cc0b7107799138d46&)

#### Iteration 3

- included another API for stock exchange search

![Stock search tsla](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170957833026666536/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_9.27.41_PM.png?ex=655aee76&is=65487976&hm=7818ef27af3b934cc01a55239181a5857422d3e828758f276903cfee6c089200&)

## Individual Code: Frontend

![Frontend Contributions](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170900865448693811/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_5.41.50_PM.png?ex=655ab968&is=65484468&hm=7759eaf8dc8efa02d76d674692cb3108ac7bf26f9b2e48756f6407392f330f35&)

![Stock & Exchange](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170907405056483378/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_6.07.55_PM.png?ex=655abf7f&is=65484a7f&hm=5cf1c797ef354927828d06af3637e4700129ef9c1594e6efcb353010605f3d5a&)

- Feature: When company name or stock symbol is inputted into the search bar and the search button is clicked, the table will be populated with information about that stock, the company, and the exchange.
- Problems with API
    1. Speed
    2. Amount of requests
- After putting it on the frontend, I realized that the API would take too long to respond and would cause an error. Moreover, I kept reaching the maximum requests allowed for the API.

#### Question 4
![Question 4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948036520849448/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.49.12_PM.png?ex=655ae557&is=65487057&hm=aba0e3118bfd66595800266e2fd4f7af53427a2b500610ba9494aefb6c9b6f53&)

Topic 3.5
This was a silly mistake.

x=7
y=3

(x < 10) && (y < 0) is not true...

Value is 7/3 = 2

There are no decimal points because we are doing integer division, thus there is no remainder.

#### Question 13

![Question 13](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948144666787850/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.49.45_PM.png?ex=655ae570&is=65487070&hm=770a866c5deadb83dc3857961fc87d11d468cc92eaddbf02f6ebe1099c7562a2&)

Topic 6.4

My Answer: 7 2 5 3 3 0
THis would be true if arr[k] and arr[k + 1] were printed instead of k and arr[k]

arr = {7, 2, 5, 3, 0, 10}

k = 0
arr[0] > arr[1] => 7 > 2
print(0 7 )

k = 1
arr[1] > arr[2] => 2 > 5

k = 2
arr[2] > arr[3] => 5 > 3
print(2 5 )

k = 3
arr[3] > arr[4] => 3 > 0
print(3 3 )

k = 4
arr[4] > arr[5] => 0 > 10

Answer: 0 7 2 5 3 3 

#### Question 15

![Question 15](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948263923437608/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.50.11_PM.png?ex=655ae58d&is=6548708d&hm=db9a13eb40ab216227910bb3a3ea80d627bfaad107a219e77868758c646993f5&)

Topic 6.2

My Answer: I and II

I. has control variable k that starts at 1 and increments by 1. The loop ends when k reaches data.length

II. has control variable k that starts at 0 and increments by 1 until data.length. 
An ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` will occur when checking ``data[data.length – 1] and data[data.length – 1 + 1]``

III. does check correctly.

Answer: I only

#### Question 23

![Question 23](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948354499416225/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.50.38_PM.png?ex=655ae5a2&is=654870a2&hm=2b598ad462acc8bd3ae3ae2a63505dd18c29c01f52ec86e4bd17755a9757c97f&)

["bear", "zebra", "bass", "cat", "koala", "baboon"]

Going backwards in the list, if the animal's name starts with b, remove the animal from that index, and put it at index 6 - k.

k = 5
"baboon" starts with b
animal.size() - k => 6 - 5 = 1
["bear", "baboon", "zebra", "bass", "cat", "koala"]

k = 4
"koala" does not start with b

k = 3
"cat" does not start with b

k = 2
"bass" does not start with b
animal.size() - k => 6 - 2 = 4
["bear", "zebra", "bass", "cat", "koala", "baboon"]

k = 1
"zebra" does not start with b

Answer: ["bear", "zebra", "bass", "cat", "koala", "baboon"]

#### Question 24

![Question 24](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948433931149413/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.50.56_PM.png?ex=655ae5b5&is=654870b5&hm=32a946ca6c55efbb96b4ca931dcb64317088f207614f3069af3ef8aab0945a9f&)

Topic 8.1

Silly mistake

New Array:
1 4 7 
2 5 8
3 6 9

newArray[0][2] = 7

I forgot my rows and columns.

#### Question 25

![Question 25](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948496417894430/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.51.12_PM.png?ex=655ae5c4&is=654870c4&hm=6f787f952e7b67c55e49ecc6322a4aba06b139ff63504b7a17f217d4857d56c8&)

Topic 5.4

A rectangular box fits inside another box if its height, width, and depth of smaller box are less than corresponding value of larger box

I. provides getHeight, getWidth, getDepth
II. methods smallerHeight, smallerWidth, and smallerDepth
III. provides get SurfaceArea and getVolume (does not mean it is smaller)

Answer: I and II

#### Question 27

![Question 27](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948591955759133/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.51.32_PM.png?ex=655ae5db&is=654870db&hm=878a98e2e88c780fad5e706f57f2fcd7e12151c49d5d72616491df7e766a5813&)

Topic 4.1

mystery(6)

x = 1
y = 1

6 > 2
x = 1 + 1 = 2
y = 2 - 1 = 1
n = 5

5 > 2
x = 2 + 1 = 3
y = 3 - 1 = 2
n = 4

4 > 2
x = 3 + 2 = 5
y = 5 - 2 = 3
n = 3

3 > 2
x = 5 + 3 = 8
y = 8 - 3 = 5
n = 2

return x = 8

#### Question 33

![Question 33](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948676357738557/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.51.54_PM.png?ex=655ae5ef&is=654870ef&hm=3bf0627f1be01638413cf7a1249a82a356f5b756fa45ade0125dbf436aafb815&)

Topic 4.1

sum = 0
k = 1

sum < 12 or k > 4
0 < 12
sum = 1

k is always greater than 4, therefore there will be an infinite loop.

#### Question 34

![Question 34](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948792166645790/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.52.20_PM.png?ex=655ae60b&is=6548710b&hm=00a5f767353ced6b9bd9de90305ed96ae14b44e327ec35fc25acb3400d086849&)

Topic 5.2

Point constructor!

I. center = new Point();
Has no parameter

II. center = new Point (a, b);
Correctly uses parameters

III. center = new Point();
    center.x = a;
    center.y = b;
Tries to update x and y, but they are private variables and cannot be accessed.

#### Question 38

![Question 38](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923041823562276894/1170948895145218120/Screenshot_2023-11-05_at_8.52.46_PM.png?ex=655ae623&is=65487123&hm=c3a3e131aa7193b6cf520863eb90845a85c87940be11d8b28af88721aac88f54&)

Topic 3.6

Silly mistake: distributed operators wrong

(y > 10000) || (x > 1000 && x < 1500)

((y > 10000) || (x > 1000)) && ((y > 10000) || (x < 1500))

## Trimester 1 Reflection

Working with Big Tracta:
- Lots of learning opportunities this trimester as other team members were more knowledgeable about coding and Java than me
    - Rachit: neural networks, stock market predictions, implementing AI into our project with ChatGPT
    - Theo: deployment, generating ideas on the whiteboard
    - Kaiden: creating functions that integrate frontend and backend, how to parse specific data from an API

Overall, I  enjoyed the time spent with my team. We worked together well most of the time. Our team worked collaboratively. I think what was unique about our team was that we each had our own strengths. Rachit was good at frontend. Theo was good at coming up with ideas. Kaiden and I focused on frontend. Our group worked collaboratively and got along, which allows us to bring new ideas to the table and further advance our project. I am proud of our resulting Stocktify project and think our features integrated together very well. However, I think our team could have done better job communicating. Next trimester, to fix communication issues, I think it would be beneficial for my group to start with aun update to begin every class to keep everybody up to date on the status of our project.

Things I have learned:
- Java
    - I came into the class with no prior knowledge on Java. Through the weeks, I have learned how to code in basic Java although I can still improve on a lot
    - Constructors, Classes, OOP, ArrayLists, etc
    - Java semi-colons make me mad

Future Plans:
- Improve on College Board MC
    - Current Score: 29/40
    - Goal after Trimester 2: 35/40
- Furthering my Java journey
    - Coding for FTC robot
    - Currently a part of the Outreach team and helping out wherever, however, this season, I will try out coding since I now have knowledge about coding
- Ideas for future projects
    - implement ChatGPT: at Night At the Museum, the chat bot feature was the most popular and seemed like the most awestriking part of our project
